# File-Renamer
A tool to rename files in bulk.
Type the extension for renaming all the files with that extension to 1, 2, ...
This helps to organize files.


Since this file is meant to be a GUI app but github doesn't support files larger than 25mb so:
pip install pyinstaller
Go to the .py file -> open powershell here
pyinstaller --onefile -w 'filename.py'
delete 'build' and 'filename.spec'
